### Work Log 02/12

Goal for the day: calculate and plot mean time-to-convergence of initial states

Steps: 
1. make base IC (Czech)
  - use bouvier et al. 2024 IC w/ varying zt0 (doing this one) OR 
    1. get regular bouvier code running
    2. port it to dcmip helper fmt
  - download and average 30 year global climatology of FCN vars
3. generate n scenarios of global warming -30 to +30 degrees about mean (Czech)
4. run all scenarios (Czech)
5. compute global-mean temp for each model
6. plot time series
